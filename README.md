# nForce2-xtreme-tweaker

The first working version of the tweaker. It is now considered EOL, due to the higher computing power required in order to run it on a old platform like socket A.
It still works, although unfinished.

For the new project, please refer to https://github.com/irusanov/nForce2-xtreme-tweaker-vcl
